# odin-recipes

This project involves building a basic recipe website where I will apply my recently acquired knowledge of HTML. 

Completing this project will demonstrate that I have sufficiently exercised my skills to construct a simple website.

Current trajectory:
    Adding some styles here and there. Putting into practice what I have learned so far from The Odin Project.

Future updates:
    Navigation bar -
        Add some distinct fancy features depending on what page you are on.
    Layout -
        Fix layout into a more organized one.
